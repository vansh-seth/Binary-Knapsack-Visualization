# Binary Knapsack Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains a web-based visualization tool for the Binary Knapsack problem, a classic algorithm in combinatorial optimization. The tool helps users understand and interact with the dynamic programming approach used to solve the Binary Knapsack problem.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Users can input their own set of items with weights and values.
- **Step-by-Step Solution**: The tool demonstrates each step of the dynamic programming algorithm.
- **Optimal Solution Display**: Highlights the items included in the optimal solution and their total value.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vansh-seth/Binary-Knapsack-Visualization.git
    cd Binary-Knapsack-Visualization/Knapsack-Visualizer-main
    ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file**:
    Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start using the visualization tool.

### Usage

1. **Input your data**: Use the web interface to enter the number of items, their respective weights, and values.

2. **View the results**: The tool will visualize the step-by-step solution and display the final optimal selection of items.

## Example

Here is a quick example to get you started:

- **Number of items**: 4
- **Item weights**: [2, 3, 4, 5]
- **Item values**: [3, 4, 5, 6]
- **Knapsack capacity**: 5

The tool will visualize how the optimal solution is computed.
